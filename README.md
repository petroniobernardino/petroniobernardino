### Hi there 👋

<!--
**petroniobernardino/petroniobernardino** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
My name is Petronio Bernardino. I am Brazilian and living in Portugal). I have a degree in computer science and a postgraduate degree in IT Management. My greatest work experience is in Business Intelligence, but I have already programmed a lot with ASP (Classic), PHP, HTML, JavaScript, CSS and several Databases.

Today I'm working with a tester(🔭), studying (🌱) a lot about automation and programming languages.

In my free time, I love being with my family and friends and having some more time, watching anime and series(📺).

Would you like to find me?
