### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Petronio Bernardino. I am Brazilian and living in Portugal). I have a degree in computer science and a postgraduate degree in IT Management. My greatest work experience is in Business Intelligence, but I have already programmed a lot with ASP (Classic), PHP, HTML, JavaScript, CSS and several Databases.

Today I'm working with a tester(ðŸ”­), studying (ðŸŒ±) a lot about automation and programming languages.

In my free time, I love being with my family and friends and having some more time, watching anime and series(ðŸ“º).
